	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large inputs. Common time complexities include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(nÂ²).

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm needs to run to completion. Like time complexity, it's expressed using Big O notation. For example, O(n) means the space required grows linearly with the input size. Understanding space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage in programs.
